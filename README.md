# Zephyr Chat Application

## What is Zephyr Chat Application?
-  Zephyr Chat Application is my first project for Operating System subject (November 2015).
I built a chat application using IONIC, NodeJS and AugularJS.
By the way, this is my first mobile-application that I have built.

## How to Download?
* If you want all of the files (code, images, etc.)
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/zephyrmathias/chat-application.git
```
* If you want .apk file (for Android)
  - [Zephyrchat.apk]

* For iOS
```sh
* Download files
$ git clone https://github.com/zephyrmathias/chat-application.git

* And then using Command-line or Terminal to go to this folder
cd chat-application

* And add platforms for iOS by using Ionic
ionic platform add ios

* Then build an application
ionic build chatapplication

* Then you will get a xcode file, open this file on xcode so you can build an application.
```
